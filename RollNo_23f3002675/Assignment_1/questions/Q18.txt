There is a tickets table in a SQLite database that has columns type, units, and price. Each row is a customer bid for a concert ticket.

type	units	price  
Bronze	578	1.32  
GOLD	844	1.76  
SILVER	258	1.07  
gold	39	0.54  
Silver	767	0.76  
...

What is the total sales of all the items in the "Gold" ticket type? Write SQL to calculate it.

Get all rows where the Type is "Gold". Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as "Gold". Calculate the sales as Units * Price, and sum them up.
