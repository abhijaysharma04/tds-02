  "answer": "# Introduction\nThis analysis looks at the number of steps walked each day over the course of a week and compares the results over time with the steps of friends.\n\n## Methodology\nWe tracked the number of steps using a smartphone app and compared the data for different days of the week.\n\n**Note:** The data was collected for a week and we analyzed the trend in walking steps.\n\n### Code Example\nTo track steps, we use the following code to retrieve the steps data:\n\n```python\nsteps = [5000, 6000, 5500, 7000, 8000, 9500, 12000]\naverage_steps = sum(steps) / len(steps)\nprint(f\"Average steps per day: {average_steps}\")\n```\n\n## Results\nHere is the summary of the data collected:\n\n### Daily Steps\n- Day 1: 5000 steps\n- Day 2: 6000 steps\n- Day 3: 5500 steps\n- Day 4: 7000 steps\n- Day 5: 8000 steps\n- Day 6: 9500 steps\n- Day 7: 12000 steps\n\n### Weekly Comparison\n1. Week 1: 50,000 steps\n2. Week 2: 48,000 steps\n\n| Day       | Steps Walked |\n|-----------|--------------|\n| Monday    | 5000         |\n| Tuesday   | 6000         |\n| Wednesday | 5500         |\n| Thursday  | 7000         |\n| Friday    | 8000         |\n| Saturday  | 9500         |\n| Sunday    | 12000        |\n\n### Reflection\nIt seems that weekends are when I tend to walk more. We also compared the data with friends:\n\n[Friend's Analysis](https://example.com) showed a steady increase over the week.\n\n![Graph](https://example.com/graph.png)\n\n> \"Walking is a great habit to keep yourself healthy.\"\n\n## Conclusion\nThe data shows a steady increase in the steps walked over the course of the week, and the trend is similar when compared to friends."
